When using do_set_part on line 134 and using set_disk on lines 144 and lines 151, BE SURE TO SET OWN PATHS FOR THE NEEDED FILES(kernel.bin, filesys.dsk, and swap.dsk).  Also, make sure to set the project variable at line 158 to indicate which current project is being worked (threads, vm, userprog, or filesys).

No filesys.dsk or no swap.dsk files.  Project is set up on certain lines that allow for adaptation of such files on the following lines: 140-145 and 147-152.
